# ToggleMode
JavaScript is a great way to make our page dynamic and add events to our page. Let's make an interesting feature for our web page. Using this feature the user can switch between two themes for their web page. We have to simulate between dark and light modes in our web page. Dark mode has black background and white text, while light mode has white background and black text. Their is a toggle button at the top and some text below it.
